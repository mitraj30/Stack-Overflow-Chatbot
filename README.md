# Stack-Overflow-Chatbot


A chatbot is an auto-mated system that responses to the user/human query and the response is generated by a machine without any human interference.
We can converse with this bot through text messaging/speech in any natural language, say English to complete a specific task. 
So we can have two types of chatbots one is a gosl oriented one and the other is the bot that can have good conversation with us. 
Nowadays entertaining bots or bots that can have some conversation with us are gaining popularity. 
Whereas goal oriented bots are the ones which may be deployed in a bank to just help them with their needs.
Theses bots can serve some specific questions and give their answers accordingly.
In this project we are only focusing on goal oriented text-based chatbot model. 
This chatbot will be capable to answer programming questions related to following languages C#, C/C++, Java, Javascript, php, Python, R, Ruby, Swift and VB.
